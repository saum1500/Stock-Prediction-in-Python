# Stock Prediction in Python
## Using Python libraries and packages to import, organize, and visualize the data pertaining to the stocks of a public company provided the ticker and start and end date. I also used Sklearn to make predictions about the closing price.  

## Data Collected
### Example ticker chosen was 'AAPL' to show the Apple stock movement from 2000 till the last trading day of 2019. This is then condensed by getting moving averages and resampling using open, high, low, close practice. 

## Visualization included
+ *Moving Averages and adjusted close price shown on simple graphs*\
+ *Candlestick graph for depicting high and low adjusted close price values for a given period*\
